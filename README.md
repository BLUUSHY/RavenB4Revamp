![Minecraft](https://img.shields.io/badge/MC-1.8.9-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to the revamped version of Raven B4, a client with a less-than-ideal bypass, now available without the goddamn $150 price tag. Credit goes to Wykt for the original leak, crack, and remap.

## Features

- **Minecraft Version:** 1.8.9
- **Revamped:** No need to pay $150 for a crappy bypass.
- **Stability:** Currently, it's a bit buggy.
